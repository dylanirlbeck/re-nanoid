## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) team, obviously, without such a beautiful yet practical language, this backend would not exist
* Thanks to [ninja-build](https://ninja-build.org), BuckleScript also comes with a blazing fast build tool on top of it, `ninja` is a truly [well engineered](http://aosabook.org/en/posa/ninja.html) scalable build tool
* Thanks to [Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com)! This project began at Bloomberg and was published in 2016; without the support of Bloomberg, it would not have happened. Now that the project has grown and developed its own community, it has moved to its own GitHub organization.

BuckleScript builds on parts of [js_of_ocaml](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml):

* [`jscomp/core/js_dump.ml`](jscomp/core/js_dump.ml) (pretty printer)

BuckleScript builds on parts of OCaml:

* [`jscomp/core/lam_pass_exits.ml`](jscomp/core/lam_pass_exits.ml)
* [`jscomp/core/lam_pass_lets_dce.ml`](jscomp/core/lam_pass_lets_dce.ml)

These modules were adapted from [`ocaml/bytecomp/simplif.ml`](ocaml/bytecomp/simplif.ml) for
JavaScript specific optimization purposes.

* [`jscomp/main/js_main.ml`](jscomp/main/js_main.ml)

`jscomp/main/js_main.ml` is adapted from [`ocaml/driver/main.ml`](ocaml/driver/main.ml). It is the main entry 
point of the underlying compiler.

*  [`jscomp/stdlib-406`](jscomp/stdlib-406)

`jscomp/stdlib-*` is copied from [`ocaml/stdlib`](ocaml/stdlib). It is compiled to JavaScript and
included with BuckleScript.

* [`jscomp/test`](jscomp/test)

`jscomp/test` is based on [`ocaml/testsuite`](ocaml/testsuite).

BuckleScript unit test builds on parts of [OUnit](http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org/)

* [`jscomp/ounit`](jscomp/ounit) is adapted from ounit, the unit test
  utilities are only used for dev purpose, they are not required for distribution

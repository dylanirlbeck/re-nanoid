   Could be exported for better inlining
   It's common that we have 
   {[ a = caml_set_oo_id([248,"string",0]) ]}
   This can be inlined as 
   {[ a = caml_set_oo_id([248,"tag", caml_oo_last_id++]) ]}
*)

let id = ref 0n


(* see  #251
   {[
     CAMLprim value caml_set_oo_id (value obj) {
       Field(obj, 1) = oo_last_id;
       oo_last_id += 2;
       return obj;
     }

   ]}*)
let caml_set_oo_id (b : Caml_builtin_exceptions.exception_block)  = 
  Caml_obj_extern.set_field (Caml_obj_extern.repr b) 1 (Caml_obj_extern.repr id.contents);
  id .contents <- Caml_nativeint_extern.add id.contents  1n; 
  b


let caml_fresh_oo_id () = 
  id .contents <- Caml_nativeint_extern.add id.contents 1n; id.contents

let object_tag = 248

let create (str : string) : Caml_builtin_exceptions.exception_block = 
  let v = ( str, caml_fresh_oo_id ()) in 
  Caml_obj_extern.set_tag (Caml_obj_extern.repr v) object_tag;
  v 

(* let makeExtension (str : string) : Caml_builtin_exceptions.exception_block =  *)
(*   let v = ( str, get_id ()) in  *)
(*   Caml_obj_extern.set_tag (Caml_obj_extern.repr v) object_tag; *)

(**
   This function should never throw
   It could be either customized exception or built in exception 
   Note due to that in OCaml extensible variants have the same 
   runtime representation as exception, so we can not 
   really tell the difference. 

   However, if we make a false alarm, classified extensible variant 
   as exception, it will be OKAY for nested pattern match

   {[
     match toExn x : exn option with 
     | Some _ 
       -> Js.log "Could be an OCaml exception or an open variant"
     (* If it is an Open variant, it will never pattern match, 
        This is Okay, since exception could never have exhaustive pattern match

     *)
     | None -> Js.log "Not an OCaml exception for sure"
   ]}

   However, there is still something wrong, since if user write such code
   {[
     match toExn x with 
     | Some _ -> (* assert it is indeed an exception *)
       (* This assertion is wrong, since it could be an open variant *)
     | None -> (* assert it is not an exception *)
   ]}

   This is not a problem in `try .. with` since the logic above is not expressible, see more design in [destruct_exn.md]

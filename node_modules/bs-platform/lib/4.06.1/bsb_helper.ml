   concatenated pairwise).

val create : int -> t
(** [create n] returns a fresh buffer, initially empty.
   The [n] parameter is the initial size of the internal byte sequence
   that holds the buffer contents. That byte sequence is automatically
   reallocated when more than [n] characters are stored in the buffer,
   but shrinks back to [n] characters when [reset] is called.
   For best performance, [n] should be of the same order of magnitude
   as the number of characters that are expected to be stored in
   the buffer (for instance, 80 for a buffer that holds one output
   line).  Nothing bad will happen if the buffer grows beyond that
   limit, however. In doubt, take [n = 16] for instance.
   If [n] is not between 1 and {!Sys.max_string_length}, it will
   be clipped to that interval. *)
